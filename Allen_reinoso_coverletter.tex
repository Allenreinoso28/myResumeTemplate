\textbf{Re: Application for \PositionTitle{} Co-op Position} \\

Dear Hiring Manager, \\

I am a third-year Computer Science co-op student at Toronto Metropolitan University with a 3.81/4.33 GPA, applying for the \PositionTitle{} Co-op position at \CompanyName{}. Through academic and team-based projects, I have developed experience in \RelevantSkills{} and am eager to contribute these skills within your Data Management Systems team.

I am available for a 12–16 month work term beginning May 2026 and am eligible to work in Canada without restriction. I am particularly interested in supporting Web Development initiatives while remaining flexible to contribute where needed.

As Lead Web Developer for TMU’s robotics team, I built and maintained a React dashboard used to monitor real-time rover telemetry during competition operations. This required integrating ROS2 and WebSockets, debugging performance issues, and designing modular components for scalability while collaborating with multidisciplinary hardware and software teams using iterative development and testing practices.

In addition, my role as a Crew Trainer at McDonald’s strengthened my leadership and teamwork skills through mentoring staff and managing operations in fast-paced environments, reinforcing the importance of communication and accountability when working toward shared goals.

I am drawn to \CompanyName{} because of \RelevantMission{}, and I am motivated by opportunities to support \RelevantReason{} while continuing to grow as a software developer.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team. \\

Sincerely, \\

\Name{} \\
Third-Year B.Sc. (Hons) Computer Science Co-op Student \\
Toronto Metropolitan University
