\textbf{Re: Application for \PositionTitle{} Co-op Position} \\

Dear Hiring Manager, \\

I am a third-year Computer Science student in the Co-op program at Toronto Metropolitan University, maintaining a 3.81/4.33 GPA, and I am excited to apply for the Full-Stack Developer co-op position at GEF Consulting Inc. I am particularly drawn to this role because it offers hands-on experience building internal software tools that directly support consulting operations and improve organizational efficiency.

I bring practical experience developing full-stack web applications using JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and backend technologies such as Node.js, REST APIs, and database-driven architectures. Through academic projects and team-based development work, I have gained experience across the full software development lifecycle, including planning, implementation, testing, debugging, and deployment. I am comfortable working with Git-based version control and writing clean, maintainable code.

As the Lead Web Developer for TMU’s robotics team, I developed and maintained a React-based dashboard to visualize real-time rover telemetry data. This work involved translating operational requirements into scalable UI components, integrating backend data streams, and troubleshooting performance and data-flow issues. Collaborating within a multidisciplinary team strengthened my ability to communicate with stakeholders, document system workflows, and deliver reliable software under real-world constraints.

In addition to my technical background, I bring strong communication and organizational skills from my role as a Crew Trainer at McDonald’s, where I mentored new team members, documented procedures, and balanced competing priorities in a fast-paced environment. These experiences reinforced my ability to work independently, adapt quickly, and maintain attention to detail.

I am particularly interested in GEF Consulting Inc. because of your focus on building modern internal applications that streamline workflows and enhance collaboration. I am eager to contribute my full-stack development skills while continuing to grow through long-term, hands-on experience in a consulting-driven environment.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and interests align with the Full-Stack Developer role at GEF Consulting Inc.

Sincerely, \\[0.75em]
