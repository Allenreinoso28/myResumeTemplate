\textbf{Re: Application for Intern, Full Stack Software Developer} \\[1em]

Dear Hiring Manager, \\

I am a third-year Computer Science co-op student at Toronto Metropolitan University with a 3.81/4.33 GPA, applying for the Intern, Full Stack Software Developer position at The Home Depot Canada. I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to customer-facing and internal platforms while gaining hands-on experience in a production environment focused on scale, quality, and impact.

As the Web Development Lead for TMU’s robotics team, I design and build full-stack web applications used in real-world engineering contexts. I developed a React-based dashboard to visualize real-time rover telemetry, integrating backend services with ROS2 and WebSocket communication. Through this work, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to define requirements, followed Agile workflows, and delivered maintainable, modular features aligned with our team's needs. This experience strengthened my understanding of RESTful APIs, object-oriented design, and building reliable systems under performance constraints.

My technical foundation includes experience with Java, JavaScript, SQL, HTML/CSS, and full-stack application development, supported by coursework in software engineering, data structures, and database systems. I am comfortable using Git for version control, participating in code reviews, and adapting quickly to new frameworks and tools. I am particularly interested in growing my backend skills in Java-based services and contributing to scalable applications that support both customers and associates.

In addition to my technical background, I bring strong communication and accountability from my role as a Crew Trainer at McDonald’s. I regularly mentored new team members, coordinated tasks in fast-paced environments, and upheld quality standards under pressure. These experiences have shaped my ability to collaborate effectively, provide clear status updates, and take ownership of responsibilities within a team.

I am drawn to The Home Depot’s focus on building technology-driven solutions that power retail experiences at scale. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to Home Depot while continuing to learn from experienced engineers and mentors throughout the internship program.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to your team. \\[1em]
