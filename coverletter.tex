\textbf{Re: Application for \PositionTitle{} Co-op Position} \\[0.5em]

Dear Hiring Manager, \\[0.5em]

I am a third-year Computer Science student in the Co-op program at Toronto Metropolitan University, maintaining a 3.85/4.33 GPA. 
I am excited to apply for the \PositionTitle{} position at \CompanyName{} for the May 2026 to April 2027 term. 
With experience developing \RelevantSkills{}, I am eager to contribute to your team and further strengthen my skills in mobile and back-end development through hands-on collaboration.

As the Lead Web Developer for TMU’s robotics team, I designed and implemented a React-based dashboard to visualize real-time rover telemetry using ROS2 and WebSocket integration. 
This experience deepened my understanding of modular architectures, agile collaboration, and building responsive systems that interface seamlessly between hardware and software, all of which align well with the software engineering principles fostered at \CompanyName{}. 

My coursework in Data Structures and Algorithms has also strengthened my analytical and problem-solving abilities. 
Through these courses, I gained extensive experience writing optimized algorithms and exploring advanced programming paradigms in languages such as Rust and Haskell. 
This exposure taught me to reason about performance, memory safety, and functional abstractions, skills that enhance my ability to write efficient, maintainable, and reliable software in any environment.

I am particularly drawn to \CompanyName{} because of \RelevantMission{}. 
I am inspired by \RelevantReason{}, and I am excited about the opportunity to learn from experienced engineers while contributing to the development of high-quality mobile and IoT software products. 
The chance to work with emerging technologies and participate in the full software development life cycle strongly aligns with my goal of becoming a versatile and impactful software developer.

Thank you for considering my application. 
I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to \CompanyName{}’s mission of creating innovative solutions that connect and empower organizations worldwide. \\[0.5em]

Sincerely, \\[0.5em]
\Name{} (He/Him) \\
Third-Year B.Sc. (Hons Co-op) Computer Science Candidate \\
Toronto Metropolitan University
