\textbf{Re: Application for \PositionTitle{} Co-op Position} \\[0.5em]

Dear Hiring Manager, \\[0.5em]

I am a third-year Computer Science student in the Co-op program at Toronto Metropolitan University, maintaining a 3.85/4.33 GPA. 
I am excited to apply for the \PositionTitle{} position at \CompanyName{} for the January–April 2026 term. 
With hands-on experience developing \RelevantSkills{}, I am eager to contribute my technical, analytical, and collaborative skills to your team.

As the Lead Web Developer for TMU’s robotics team, I developed a React-based dashboard to visualize real-time rover data, integrating ROS2 and WebSockets to enhance performance during the University Rover Challenge. 
This project strengthened my understanding of scalable UI design, modular software development, and agile teamwork within a multidisciplinary environment. 
Additionally, my coursework in Data Structures, Software Engineering, and Database Systems has provided a strong foundation in algorithms, software architecture, and problem-solving.

Beyond my technical experience, I bring strong teamwork and leadership skills from my role as a Crew Trainer at McDonald’s, where I mentored new team members, managed priorities under pressure, 
and maintained high performance standards. These experiences reinforced my ability to communicate clearly and collaborate effectively, skills I consider essential in fast-paced development environments.

I am particularly drawn to \CompanyName{} because of \RelevantMission{}. 
I am inspired by \RelevantReason{}, and I am eager to apply my skills to support your cloud-based Human Capital Management platform while continuing to grow as a \PositionTitle{} within your organization. 
In addition, my Co-op Student Advisor at Toronto Metropolitan University, who previously interned at Dayforce, shared extremely positive experiences about the company’s collaborative culture, mentorship, and growth opportunities. 
Hearing firsthand how supportive and technically enriching the environment was further strengthened my enthusiasm to join your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to \CompanyName{}’s continued success. \\[0.5em]

Sincerely, \\[0.75em]
\Name{} (He/Him) \\
Third-Year B.Sc. (Hons Co-op) Computer Science Candidate \\
