\textbf{Re: Application for \PositionTitle{} – 16-Month Internship (May 2026 – August 2027)} \\[0.5em]

Dear Hiring Manager, \\[0.5em]

I am a third-year Computer Science Co-op student at Toronto Metropolitan University, maintaining a 3.85/4.33 GPA. 
I am excited to apply for the \PositionTitle{} position at \CompanyName{}. 
With hands-on experience developing \RelevantSkills{}, I am eager to contribute to Celestica’s innovative engineering and data analytics initiatives.

As the Lead Web Developer for TMU’s robotics team, I designed and implemented a React-based dashboard to monitor real-time rover telemetry using ROS2 and WebSockets. 
This experience strengthened my skills in data visualization, modular design, and system integration and I believe that these are key competencies for managing analytical tools and automation systems in global engineering environments. 
Additionally, my academic background in Software Engineering and Data Structures has equipped me with the technical foundation to analyze, build, and optimize data-driven applications efficiently.

Beyond my technical projects, I bring strong communication and leadership abilities from my role as a Crew Trainer at McDonald’s, 
where I mentored new team members, coordinated operations under pressure, and ensured quality standards. 
These experiences taught me to adapt quickly, manage priorities, and collaborate effectively. I think these skills align with Celestica’s emphasis on cross-functional teamwork and continuous improvement.

I am particularly drawn to \CompanyName{} because of \RelevantMission{}. 
I am inspired by your focus on \RelevantReason{}, and I would be proud to contribute to the development of analytics tools that support global engineering excellence and sustainability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Celestica’s mission of shaping the future through technology and innovation. \\[2em]

Sincerely, \\[0.75em]

Third-Year B.Sc. (Hons Co-op) Computer Science Candidate \\
