\textbf{Re: Application for \PositionTitle{} Co-op Position} \\[1em]

Dear Hiring Manager, \\[1em]

I am a third-year Computer Science student in the Co-op program at Toronto Metropolitan University, maintaining a 3.85/4.33 GPA. 
I am excited to apply for the \PositionTitle{} Co-op position at \CompanyName{}. 
With hands-on experience developing \RelevantSkills{}, I am eager to contribute my technical, analytical, and collaborative skills to your team.

As the Lead Web Developer for TMU’s robotics team, I developed a React-based dashboard 
to visualize real-time rover data, to enhance performance during the University Rover Challenge. 
This experience strengthened my understanding of scalable UI design, modular development, and agile collaboration within a multidisciplinary team. 

I am also passionate about creating technology that supports better financial decision-making. In a personal project, I designed and developed a budgeting and 
expense tracking web application that enables users to easily visualize spending habits and maintain transactional accuracy. Crafting this interface taught me 
how trust, clarity, and usability shape user confidence in financial tools. This experience directly motivates me to contribute to Block’s mission of expanding 
economic access through intuitive and reliable financial technology.

% Beyond my technical experience, I bring strong teamwork and leadership skills from my role as a 
% Crew Trainer at McDonald’s, where I mentored new team members, managed priorities under pressure, 
% and maintained high performance standards. These experiences reinforced my ability to communicate clearly 
% and collaborate effectively, which I believe are both essential in fast-paced development environments.

I am particularly drawn to \CompanyName{} because of \RelevantMission{}. 
I am inspired by your focus on \RelevantReason{}, and I am eager to apply my skills to support your ongoing projects 
while continuing to grow as a \PositionTitle{} within your organization. 

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute 
to \CompanyName{}’s success. \\[1em]

Sincerely, \\[0.75em]

Third-Year B.Sc. (Hons Co-op) Computer Science Candidate \\
