\textbf{Re: Application for \PositionTitle{} – Summer 2026 Co-op} \\[1em]

Dear Hiring Manager, \\[1em]

I am a third-year Computer Science student in the Co-op program at Toronto Metropolitan University, maintaining a 3.85/4.33 GPA. 
I am excited to apply for the \PositionTitle{} at \CompanyName{}. 
With hands-on experience developing \RelevantSkills{}, I am eager to contribute my technical, analytical, and collaborative skills to your team.

As the Lead Web Developer for TMU’s robotics team, I developed a React-based dashboard 
to visualize real-time rover data, integrating ROS2 and WebSockets to enhance performance during competitions. 
This experience strengthened my skills in scalable UI development, API integration, and agile teamwork—directly aligning with 
\CompanyName{}’s focus on building reliable and innovative digital solutions using JavaScript, React, and cloud technologies. 
Additionally, my coursework in Software Engineering and AI/ML has given me a strong foundation in problem-solving, testing, and software design patterns.

Beyond my technical experience, I bring strong teamwork and leadership skills from my role as a 
Crew Trainer at McDonald’s, where I mentored new team members, managed priorities under pressure, 
and maintained high performance standards. These experiences reinforced my ability to communicate clearly 
and collaborate effectively, which I believe are both essential in fast-paced development environments.

I am particularly drawn to \CompanyName{} because of \RelevantMission{}. 
Your values-first culture and the GRO early talent program demonstrate a dedication to mentorship and long-term growth that deeply resonates with me. 
I’m eager to contribute to your mission of making decisions easier and lives better through software that delivers real business value.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute 
to \CompanyName{}’s success. \\[2em]

Sincerely, \\[0.75em]

Third-Year B.Sc. (Hons Co-op) Computer Science Candidate \\
