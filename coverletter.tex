Dear SHN Co-op Placement Coordinator,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is \Name, and I am a third-year Computer Science co-op student at Toronto Metropolitan University, maintaining a strong academic standing with a 3.85 GPA. I am writing to express my interest in contributing to \CompanyName\ through a co-op placement focused on software development, digital health systems, or data-driven technology solutions.

What draws me to SHN is the meaningful connection between technology and compassionate patient care. I am inspired by SHN’s commitment to improving the accessibility, reliability, and efficiency of healthcare services across our community. I am motivated by the opportunity to support initiatives that enhance clinical workflows, improve information systems, and ultimately help deliver better experiences and outcomes for patients and staff.

My technical background includes hands-on experience building real-time and data-centric applications. As the Lead Web Developer for TMU’s robotics team, I designed and implemented a real-time operational dashboard using React, TypeScript, and WebSockets to interface with hardware in the field. This project strengthened my ability to collaborate in interdisciplinary environments and develop reliable, user-centered systems. I also have strong experience in Python, SQL, Docker, and cloud-based development, alongside coursework in software engineering, algorithms, and data management.

I would welcome the chance to bring my technical skills, curiosity, and dedication to SHN’s mission. I would be happy to provide any additional materials you may require, including my resume, academic transcript, and references.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to a team that is making a meaningful impact in our communities.

\Name
