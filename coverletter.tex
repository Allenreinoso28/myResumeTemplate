\textbf{Re: Application for \PositionTitle} \\[1em]

Dear Hiring Manager, \\[1em]

I am a third-year Computer Science Co-op student at Toronto Metropolitan University, maintaining a 3.85/4.33 GPA, and I am excited to apply for the \PositionTitle{} at \CompanyName{}. I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because of \RelevantMission{}, and the chance to contribute to meaningful technology used by millions of Canadians. I am eager to bring my technical skills, curiosity, and collaborative mindset to your team.

As the Lead Web Developer for TMU’s robotics team, I designed and implemented a real-time dashboard using React, TypeScript, and WebSockets to monitor rover systems during field operations. This experience strengthened my ability to architect modular interfaces, work across system layers, and collaborate with multidisciplinary teammates under evolving requirements. I developed a strong foundation in debugging, iterative design, and communicating technical decisions clearly. I believe these skills are core to impactful software development.

Beyond this project experience, I have applied computer science fundamentals in coursework and personal work involving Python, SQL, Docker, and cloud-based development workflows. I am comfortable working with version control (Git), writing maintainable code, and applying testing practices to ensure reliability. I am also experienced working in fast-paced, team-oriented environments through leadership roles outside of engineering, where I learned to remain adaptable, organized, and supportive of others.

I am inspired by \CompanyName{}’s Co-op program because of \RelevantReason{}. The opportunity to learn from experienced engineers, contribute to production systems, and grow alongside other student developers is exactly the environment I am looking for as I continue developing as a software engineer.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the chance to further discuss how my experiences and interests align with the goals of your team. \\[2em]

Sincerely, \\[0.75em]
