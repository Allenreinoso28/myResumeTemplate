\textbf{Re: Application for \PositionTitle{} Co-op Position} \\[0.5em]

Dear Hiring Manager, \\[0.5em]

I am a third-year Computer Science co-op student at Toronto Metropolitan University, and I am excited to apply for the Front-End Developer Student position at OLG for the Winter 2026 term. With hands-on experience designing and developing \RelevantSkills{}, I am eager to bring my technical mindset, attention to detail, and collaborative problem-solving skills to the OLG Digital Technology team.

As the Lead Web Developer for TMU’s competitive robotics team, I developed a real-time React-based dashboard used to visualize rover telemetry during the University Rover Challenge. I worked closely with hardware and autonomy teams to gather requirements, ensure UI/UX feasibility, and iteratively improve usability and performance. This experience strengthened my skills in modular front-end architecture, component reusability, responsive layout design, and agile team collaboration.

I also implemented WebSocket-based communication between the interface and ROS2 systems, which required careful debugging, unit testing, and refinement to maintain reliability across diverse runtime environments. These challenges helped build my ability to identify risks early, discuss trade-offs with teammates, and deliver features that balance technical correctness with end-user experience.

I am particularly drawn to \CompanyName{} because of \RelevantMission{}. I am inspired by \RelevantReason{} and would value the opportunity to contribute to meaningful digital products used across the province. I am also energized by OLG’s support for student development, mentorship, and community engagement initiatives.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my background, curiosity, and dedication to clean, maintainable front-end code can support the success of OLG’s digital platform initiatives. \\[2em]

Sincerely, \\[0.75em]

Third-Year B.Sc. (Hons Co-op) Computer Science Candidate \\
