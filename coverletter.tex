\textbf{Re: Application for \PositionTitle{} Co-op Position} \\[0.5em]

Dear Hiring Manager, \\[0.5em]

I am a third-year Computer Science student in the Co-op program at Toronto Metropolitan University with a 3.85/4.33 GPA, and I am excited to apply for the \PositionTitle{} position at \CompanyName{} for the Summer 2025 term. With experience developing \RelevantSkills{}, I am eager to contribute to the A-Team and support the creation of tools, features, and gameplay systems that enhance the player experience across EA SPORTS titles.

As the Lead Web Developer for TMU’s robotics team, I designed and built a real-time dashboard to interface with our rover’s ROS2 backend. This system streamed live telemetry and control signals through WebSockets, enabling responsive visualizations and precise manual and autonomous control. This experience strengthened my ability to reason about latency, data synchronization, and resilient system design — all important when building systems that must feel fluid, natural, and reliable, much like gameplay input and animation pipelines in modern sports titles.

I have also developed full-stack web applications such as collaborative coding and algorithm training platforms using React, Next.js, and MongoDB. These projects reinforced my focus on clean component architecture, usability, and maintainable system boundaries. Combined with coursework in algorithms, distributed systems, Rust, and functional programming, I have developed a strong foundation in writing efficient, readable, and performance-aware software.

I am particularly drawn to \CompanyName{} because of \RelevantMission{}. I am inspired by \RelevantReason{}, and I value how the A-Team collaborates with gameplay, UI, and engine groups to improve core player experiences. The opportunity to contribute to widely played and culturally meaningful games aligns strongly with my goal of building software that connects and inspires people.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be excited to further discuss how my technical background and collaborative mindset can support the A-Team and the future of EA SPORTS experiences. \\[0.5em]

Sincerely, \\[0.5em]

Third-Year B.Sc. (Hons) Computer Science Co-op Candidate \\
