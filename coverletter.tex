\textbf{Re: Application for \PositionTitle{} Co-op Position} \\[1em]

Dear Hiring Manager, \\[1em]

I am a third-year Computer Science student in the Co-op program at Toronto Metropolitan University, maintaining a 3.85/4.33 GPA. 
I am excited to apply for the \PositionTitle{} Co-op position at \CompanyName{}. 
With hands-on experience developing \RelevantSkills{}, I am eager to contribute my technical, analytical, and collaborative skills to your team.

As the Lead Web Developer for TMU’s robotics team, I developed a React-based dashboard 
to visualize real-time rover data, integrating ROS2 and WebSockets to enhance performance during the University Rover Challenge. 
This experience strengthened my understanding of scalable UI design, modular development, and agile collaboration within a multidisciplinary team. 
Additionally, my coursework in Data Structures, Software Engineering, and AI/ML has given me a strong foundation in problem-solving and software architecture.

Beyond my technical experience, I bring strong teamwork and leadership skills from my role as a 
Crew Trainer at McDonald’s, where I mentored new team members, managed priorities under pressure, 
and maintained high performance standards. These experiences reinforced my ability to communicate clearly 
and collaborate effectively, which I believe are both essential in fast-paced development environments.

I am particularly drawn to \CompanyName{} because of \RelevantMission{}. 
I am inspired by your focus on \RelevantReason{}, and I am eager to apply my skills to support your ongoing projects 
while continuing to grow as a \PositionTitle{} within your organization. 

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute 
to \CompanyName{}’s success. \\[2em]

Sincerely, \\[0.75em]
\Name{} (He/Him) \\
Third-Year B.Sc. (Hons Co-op) Computer Science Candidate \\
Toronto Metropolitan University
