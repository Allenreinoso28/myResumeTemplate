\textbf{Re: Application for \PositionTitle{} Co-op Position} \\[1em]

Dear Hiring Manager, \\[1em]

I am a third-year Computer Science student in the Co-op program at Toronto Metropolitan University, maintaining a 3.85/4.33 GPA, and I am excited to apply for the \PositionTitle{} role at \CompanyName{}. With hands-on experience developing \RelevantSkills{}, I am eager to contribute to your Product and Data Engineering teams while continuing to grow as a developer.

As the Lead Web Developer for TMU’s robotics team (Toronto MetRobotics), I developed a React-based, real-time rover dashboard to visualize telemetry and controls using WebSockets, TypeScript, and modular, scalable UI patterns. I also integrated Python-based data relay services using a pub/sub messaging model. This work strengthened my skills in system design, code structuring, collaborative Git workflows, and CI tooling, all practices aligned with how software is developed at \CompanyName{}.

In addition, my database and software engineering coursework has provided a strong foundation in relational schema design, SQL querying, iterative development, and writing clean, maintainable code. My experience using GitHub for version control, code reviews, and project documentation will support my transition to learning your development toolchain, including Jenkins, Jira, and Confluence.

I am particularly drawn to \CompanyName{} because of \RelevantMission{}. I appreciate \RelevantReason{}, and I am especially excited about the chance to learn from experienced engineers while contributing meaningfully to real product work across multiple teams during the internship term.


Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute 
to \CompanyName{}’s success. \\[2em]

Sincerely, \\[0.75em]
\Name{} (He/Him) \\
Third-Year B.Sc. (Hons Co-op) Computer Science Candidate \\
