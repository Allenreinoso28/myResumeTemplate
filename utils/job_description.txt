Software Developer - Data Management Systems

Environment and Climate Change Canada is looking for students to join our Data Management System (DMS) development team in the role of Component Developer or Web Developer.

As a DMS Developer, you will have the opportunity to contribute to all aspects of the development process and work on complex scientific weather applications. While many organizations assign students to highly restricted roles, we expect students to grow into a role in which they participate fully in the development process as a part of a larger team. Students will gain experience in a large variety of areas, including design, coding, testing, performance analysis, debugging, system installation/configuration, code reviews, and documentation.

Over the course of their placement, our students are expected to participate in all developer roles, as well as join in reviews of their own and other projects. Students should be able to work effectively in teams and independently. To contribute effectively to our dynamic, team-based approach to software development, strong communication skills are necessary and are a key factor to success. This position is most suitable for students who are seeking to gain real-world software development experience and make a meaningful impact on the lives of millions of Canadians.

About the DMS: The Data Management System (DMS) is a mature data management project designed to modernize IT systems supporting the Meteorological Service of Canada. DMS is a high-performance computing platform that acquires, scientifically processes, quality assesses, archives, and provides access mechanisms to extremely large volumes of meteorological data collected from thousands of stations across the country in a 24/7 mission critical environment. Clients of the DMS include meteorologists, climate researchers, forest fire prevention services, the Canadian Coast Guard and the aviation industry - not to mention the Canadian public.



Data Management System - Component Development

DMS is built on a multi-node cluster running Ubuntu. It incorporates industry leading technology, such as databases, search engines, queueing systems and repository managers. Most programs are written using Java, though knowledge of C++, SQL and other scripting languages is always welcome. New technologies and ideas are always being incorporated where applicable, and contributions from past students have gone on to become a large part of a system which underlies climate-related activity across Canada.



Data Management System - Web Development

Web application developers on the DMS team are tasked with building a suite of applications to create a user-friendly bridge for our clients to interact with our weather data. Students will be working with the Angular framework and Redux-like libraries to build complex features for these applications. Development emphasizes scalable architecture, reactive design and reusable solutions.

Applicants may specify which of the development streams they prefer, but developers may be expected to work in either development stream if circumstances arise.
